        <h2>Why are we building this site?</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to claim a space in the name of Jesus. This space is created for Him. 
          This should be a great place where His people can come together and join in prayer.
          I believe that there is power in prayer and that He will answer our prayers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Why a Social Media site?</h2>
        <p>
          I have found that many sites intended to bring people together often are used to propogate the negative
          I have not found a site dedicated to working together in prayer. This site will help bring people together
          and pray for each other. My prayer is that if we are able to pray together, we will all
          be blessed by Him, and see His works be done.
          </p>
        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        <p>
          There are a many ways to help this be a success. Most of all, pray that the Lord will continue to bless 
          this project.
